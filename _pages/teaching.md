Tutor for **49928 Design Optimisation for Manufacturing** (Spring 2022, Spring 2023 & Spring 2024, University of Technology Sydney)

The increasing demand on engineers to make their 'best' possible decisions in product design and manufacturing process at decreasing costs and a faster pace requires knowledge of methods in design optimisation. Optimisation has become a necessary part of product design and decision-making activities in mechanical, manufacturing and mechatronic engineering. This subject emphasises applications of advanced optimisation techniques in product design, manufacturing and project planning. It introduces students to an array of optimisation techniques and enables students to learn to use advanced techniques applicable in solving real product design and manufacturing problems such as machine scheduling, flexible assembly system scheduling, supply chain planning, job shop scheduling, project planning and scheduling, etc. On successful completion of this subject, students are able to understand the fundamentals of optimisation techniques and apply appropriate optimisation techniques in various applications.
