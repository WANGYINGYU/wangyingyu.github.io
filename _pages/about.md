I'm a third-year Ph.D. student from [Robotics Insititute](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/robotics-institute), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. Shoudong Huang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Shoudong.Huang/) and [Dr. Liang Zhao](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Liang.Zhao/). My research interests focus on SLAM and robotics.
